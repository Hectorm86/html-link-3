        <h2>My Top 3 Favorite Games</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
            <h3>Pokemon Red/Blue</h3>
            <p>
                The first game I can ever remember playing and understanding, it was also the the hardest first choice of my life as a kid. I chose Charmander as my starter because that was the coolest of the three at the time. I played nonstop from the minute I got home till it was time to go to sleep. Catching pokemon, leveling up my team and battling all the gym leaders was a true test of my adolescent skills. I'll never forget the feeling of beating all the gym leaders only to find out I still had to battle the 4 most elite trainers of the game, to then beating all 4 after countless strategic attempts, only to then find out I still had one more crucial battle against the games rivaled character who was waiting for me at the end of league. Needless to say i threw my gameboy across the room after losing because I had used all of my healing items. It was a lesson I didnt understand till today, that no matter how far you think you've come, there's always more to challenge and more to achieve in life, don't settle for less than your best always.
